				<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span> Who Is Laundry House?</h3>
				<p>Laundry House is the premiere laundromat in the south south region. We use state-of-the-art equipment in the most impressive self-serve laundry facility you will have ever seen. It is custom-designed and built for your comfort and convenience. Massage chairs, free WiFi, movies playing, study tables, friendly staff, spacious folding tables and most importantly - our facilities are kept spotless. Laundry House Laundry Pickup & Delivery Service provides customers a next-day, professional wash, dry and fold, Pickup and Delivery laundry service. You can rest assured that our experienced staff will be extremely careful with your order and impress you with our attention to detail.</p>

				<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span> What are your store hours?</h3>
				<p>Laundry House was created for convenience and we are open 7am - 10pm Daily. Last wash starts at 8.45pm (meaning you must start your wash cycle by 8.45pm, allowing you sufficient time to use our dryers). We close the store at 10.00 p.m. for the safety of our customers and employees.</p>

				<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span> Do you have large machines?</h3>
				<p>Yes, Laundry House offers the largest selection of washers and dryers in the Alakahia region. We have 35+ super large washers as well as 36 large and ultra large dryers that can handle all your large items, such as comforters, blankets, beach towels, pillows, etc.. Our store can wash over 2400 lbs. of laundry per hour and dry over 4200 lbs. per hour. That’s the Laundry House difference.Many of our customers have their own washing machines at home, but prefer to do their laundry in a fraction of the time at Laundry House, or have large items (sleeping bags, comforters, full-size flags, beach towels) that may not fit into apartment-size or other washing machines or drypers.</p>	

				<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span> Which washer size should I use to wash my clothes?</h3>
				<p>It depends on the actual size of your load. Selecting the right washer is as simple as trying it on for size. If you put the load into the washer and you find yourself having trouble closing the door, then you probably should move up to the next size machine. On the other hand, our front load washers actually work better when they are more than half full. In fact, you can fill the washer nearly completely full, just don’t stuff it tight. Leave a little room for water and agitation!For Dryers, usually about half full is recommended. The two main ingredients for drying clothes are Heat and Air. It’s common for laundromats to lower their thermostat on their dryers to save money. We don’t lower our temperatures, we want you to have the best experience possible so you’ll come back and see us again.</p>	

				<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span> May I use my own detergent in Laundry House machines?</h3>
				<p>Yes. We understand that everyone has their own preferences in which detergents and / or bleaches they would like to use. We have available a hypo-allergenic detergent in our store, but others are available online and elsewhere.</p>

				<p>Although dry cleaning is not our core business, we offer those services as a convenience and for one-stop-shopping for our customers at very competitive prices. Please identify and place those items in a separate bag.</p>								
				<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span> What if I have delicates or other special laundry needs?</h3>
				<p>Our laundry professionals will make sure your clothes receive the attention they need. Place special need items in a plastic (grocery) bag with a note, or indicate your request on the inventory sheet. If you would like to provide special soap for us to use we are happy to use it</p>
