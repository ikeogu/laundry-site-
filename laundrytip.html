				<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span> What is the best way to complete your laundry wash?</h3>
				<p>The best way to complete a wash load of laundry involves several steps:<br>
				<ol>
					<li>sorting your dirty clothes,</li>
					<li>selecting your detergent</li>
					<li>determining which washer and dryer settings you should use.</li>
				</ol>
						Sorting your laundry is the first step. The best way to do laundry is to separate your whites from your darks. If you don’t, the colors may bleed and tint your white articles. As you sort your clothes, you should check your pockets to ensure that items like money, receipts, gum, or crayons, won’t accidentally get thrown in the wash.<br><br>

						Take any items that are heavily or newly stained and set them aside. To ensure that these stains come out, you might want to pre-treat these spots with either a product designed specifically for this purpose or a bit of your usual detergent. Rub these products gently over the stained area. Many varieties of pretreatment sticks and gels are sold at most grocery stores.
						<br><br>

						The best way to do laundry is to follow the instructions on your garments when deciding whether to use hot or cold water. Your garments’ tags should also indicate what setting it should be washed on. Dry-clean only items should never be put in a washing machine. After sorting your clothes by color, you should also inspect each item’s tags and sort those that require the same settings and temperatures into subgroups. Sorting laundry is an important part of the best way to do laundry.<br><br>

						There are many types of detergent, bleach and fabric softener, but the best way to do laundry is to find the products that best suit your clothes. Detergents that contain bleach, for example, should only be used on whites. Some detergents are created for use in high efficiency washing machines; others are scented. Choose the right detergent for your needs; then pour the correct amount into your machine. Using too little detergent means your clothes will not be thoroughly cleaned. Too much detergent may not rinse completely from your items.<br><br>

						After your clothes have been washed, you need to dry them according to the directions on their labels. The best way to do laundry is to pay attention to the heat and intensity setting each clothing item requires. Some clothes cannot be dried in a machine at all, and must either be hung or laid flat. Once your clothes are dry, remove them from the dryer and fold or handle them right away to prevent wrinkles.<br><br>

				<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span> Stain Removal Tips:</h3>
				<p><strong>First, a few rules:</strong> No matter how much you feel like doing it, do not rub a stain - pat it gently instead. Rubbing will push the stain further into the fabric. Patting will absorb at least some of the stain into the rag or napkin you are patting it with. Rubbing damp silk, for example, will damage the material.<br><br>
				<strong>Applying Water or Clear Soda Water?</strong> Either one will usually dilute a stain and make it easier to remove later.If you have a surface stain (like spaghetti sauce), place the garment stain down on a towel or rag and pat the stain removal liquid (i.e. water or liquid detergent) from the backside so as to move the stain on to the towel. If you pat from the stained side you will push the stain further into the fabric. Some stains (such as coffee with cream and sugar) may have many different components all taking a different stain removal process, so be patient. Never machine dry a garment before removing the stains. They will be permanently set. The older the stain, the more difficult to it is to remove. Don't procrastinate - get it out as soon as possible. Oily type stains must be removed at once, as they will yellow with age.<br></br>
				<strong>Beverages (coffee, tea, soft drinks, wine, alcoholic drinks, fruit juice)</strong> - rinse stain in cool water. Preferably before the stain dries. Pre-treat with pre-wash stain remover or a mild laundry detergent and white vinegar. If the stain is still there after laundering, try an enzyme detergent (like ERA) or go back to the first step. Presoak if possible.<br><br>
				<strong>Blood, egg, urine, vomit, feces or other animal type stains</strong> - scrape off any residue then soak freshly stained garment in cold water for 30 minutes and rinse. Gently rub detergent into any remaining stain. Rinse and then launder. If any stain remains or the stain is dry, soak in lukewarm water with an enzyme product (like ERA) and then launder.<br><br>
				<strong>Fruit, mustard, grass, tobacco or other plant type stains</strong> - rinse with cool water and treat with a milk detergent and white vinegar before washing or presoak in an enzyme product (like ERA) in the warmest water safe for the fabric. Then launder as usual. May need to repeat if stain is not completely gone.<br><br>
				<strong>Grease, motor oil, salad dressing, butter, cooking oil, cosmetics, crayon</strong> - light stains can be pretreated with a spray stain remove. Heavier stains require a mild laundry detergent mixed with household ammonia, or detergent mixed with a detergent booster. Launder in hottest water safe for the fabric. Remember pat only, no rubbing. Will have to repeat several times for heavy stains. Very heavy oil may require a solvent-based stain removal product - see candle wax below.
				<br><br>
				<strong></strong>Perspiration - treat with pre-wash stain remover, or dampen stain and rub with bar soap. If the color of the fabric has changed slightly, apply ammonia to fresh stain or white vinegar to old stain, rinse. Launder in hottest water safe for that fabric. Stubborn stains may respond to pre-treating (soak) with an enzyme product, like ERA, and then launder using all-fabric bleach.<br><br>
				<strong>Candle wax, lipstick</strong> - gently lift off larger pieces. Treat with a solvent based stain removal product (K2R, Goof-Off). Again, pat from the backside into a cloth. Then wash in the hottest water safe for that fabric. Test colored items first.<br></p>
